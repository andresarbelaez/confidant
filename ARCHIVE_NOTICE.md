## Note on File Organization

Due to file system permissions, some files could not be physically moved to the `archive/` directory. They remain in the root directory but are marked as archived in their headers and in this document.

The `archive/` directory structure is set up for future organization:
- `archive/python-implementation/` - For Python code
- `archive/analysis-docs/` - For historical analysis

## Contributing

When contributing to Confidant, focus on:
- `desktop/` directory - Current implementation
- `docs/` directory - Current documentation
- Files in root marked as "Current" or without archive notices

Ignore or reference archived files only for historical context.
