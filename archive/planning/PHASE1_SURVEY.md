Title: Survey: Would you download 3-7GB for offline, private health/legal consultation?

Body:
Hi everyone! I'm working on a privacy-first health and legal consultation app that works completely offline. To provide comprehensive knowledge, the app would require downloading a 3GB health knowledge base or 7GB legal knowledge base.

I'm trying to understand if people would be willing to download knowledge bases of this size for offline, private consultation. The survey takes about 5 minutes and your input would be incredibly valuable!

Thanks in advance!

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Thresholds

**Health (3GB)**:
- >50% "Yes, definitely" or "Yes, probably" = Proceed
- 30-50% "Yes" = Consider reducing size
- <30% "Yes" = Re-evaluate strategy

**Legal (7GB)**:
- >40% "Yes, definitely" or "Yes, probably" = Proceed
- 25-40% "Yes" = Consider reducing size or modular approach
- <25% "Yes" = Re-evaluate strategy

**Privacy Importance**:
- Average >7/10 = Strong motivator
- Average 5-7/10 = Moderate motivator
- Average <5/10 = Weak motivator

**Modular Preference**:
- >60% prefer modular = Implement modular approach
- 40-60% prefer modular = Consider modular
- <40% prefer modular = All-in-one may be acceptable

## Data Analysis

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Download Willingness**:
   - Q7 (Health 3GB): % "Yes"
   - Q12 (Legal 7GB): % "Yes"

2. **Privacy Importance**:
