# dant: 30-Second Pitch

## Standard Pitch

**The Problem**: Every conversation with ChatGPT or Claude is collected, stored, and used for training. Your sensitive questions about health, legal issues, or personal matters are stored on servers you don't control. Plus, you need internet, pay monthly fees, and have no ownership.

**The Solution**: dant is an AI assistant that runs completely offline on a Raspberry Pi. Your conversations never leave your device—zero data collection, zero tracking. It works anywhere, even without internet. You own it with a one-time purchase, no subscriptions. Add your own documents and knowledge base for a truly personalized assistant.

**The Value**: Complete privacy for sensitive conversations. Offline operation for remote locations. Full ownership and control. One-time cost instead of endless subscriptions. dant is the AI assistant for people who want intelligence without surveillance.
