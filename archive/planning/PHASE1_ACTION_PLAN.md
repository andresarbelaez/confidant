## Key Metrics to Track

### Survey Metrics

**Target**: 100+ responses minimum

**Key Questions**:
- Q7 (Health 3GB): % "Yes, definitely" or "Yes, probably"
- Q12 (Legal 7GB): % "Yes, definitely" or "Yes, probably"
- Q5 (Health privacy): Average score (1-10)
- Q10 (Legal privacy): Average score (1-10)
- Q4 (Max acceptable size): Distribution
- Q15 (Modular preference): % Prefer modular

**Success Criteria**:
- >50% "Yes" to 3GB health = Proceed
- >40% "Yes" to 7GB legal = Proceed
- Average privacy importance >7/10 = Strong motivator
- >60% prefer modular = Implement modular

### Social Media Metrics

**Key Signals**:
- Frequency of requests for offline apps
- Complaints about large app downloads
- Privacy concerns with health/legal
- Willingness to download large files

**Success Criteria**:
- More positive signals than negative = Proceed
- Mixed signals = Proceed with modifications
- More negative signals = Re-evaluate

## Deliverables

### Week 1 Deliverables

1. ✅ **Competitive Analysis Document** (`PHASE1_COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md`)
2. **Survey Document** (`PHASE1_SURVEY.md`)
3. **Social Media Listening Guide** (`PHASE1_SOCIAL_MEDIA_LISTENING.md`)
4. **Live Survey Link** (Google Forms)
5. **Monitoring System** (Google Alerts, spreadsheet)

### Week 2 Deliverables

1. **Survey Results** (100+ responses)
2. **Social Media Listening Findings** (compiled data)
3. **Phase 1 Validation Report** (analysis and recommendations)

---

## Success Criteria

### Go Decision (Proceed to Phase 2)

**If**:
- >50% survey respondents say "Yes" to 3GB health
- >40% survey respondents say "Yes" to 7GB legal
- Average privacy importance >7/10
- More positive than negative social media signals
- Competitive analysis supports feasibility

**Then**: Proceed to Phase 2 (Landing page + MVP prototype)

### Modify Decision (Reduce Sizes)

**If**:
- 30-50% say "Yes" to 3GB/7GB
- Size concerns but privacy helps
- Modular approach preferred
- Mixed social media signals

**Then**: Reduce to 2GB health, 5GB legal, proceed to Phase 2 with modifications

### Pivot Decision (Re-evaluate Strategy)

**If**:
- <30% say "Yes" to 3GB+
- Size is major barrier
- Privacy not enough to justify size
- More negative than positive social media signals

**Then**: Re-evaluate strategy, consider streaming hybrid, cloud hybrid, or significantly reduced sizes
