# Confidant Nonprofit Formation Checklist (Maryland, US)

---

## Do Now (No Payment)

### 1. Lock in the name and check it’s free
- Decide the exact legal name (e.g. **Confidant Foundation, Inc.**).
- Search [Maryland SDAT](https://dat.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx) and [IRS EO Select Check](https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/) to ensure the name isn’t already in use.
- **Cost:** Free.

### 2. Draft your mission (one paragraph)
- Write one clear paragraph: who you serve, what you do (e.g. develop and provide Confidant as a free, privacy-first mental health companion), and that it’s for charitable/educational purposes.
- You’ll paste this into Articles, Form 1023, and fundraising materials.
- **Cost:** Free.

### 3. Recruit / confirm your initial board (at least 3)
- Identify 3 people (unpaid is fine) who can serve as directors, with no conflict of interest (e.g. not the only developer who’d get paid by the org later without board approval).
- Get verbal or email agreement. You’ll need names and addresses for state and IRS forms.
- **Cost:** Free.

### 4. Draft bylaws
- Use a 501(c)(3) template (e.g. from [Maryland Nonprofits](https://www.mdnonprofit.org/), Nolo, or a lawyer’s sample). Adapt: name, mission, number of directors, how officers are chosen, meetings, conflict of interest, amendment process, dissolution (assets to another 501(c)(3) or government).
- **Cost:** Free if you do it yourself.

### 5. Prepare Articles of Incorporation text
- Use Maryland SDAT’s form or instructions for a **nonstock nonprofit**.
- Include: name, purpose (your mission paragraph), statement that it’s nonstock, and the **required dissolution clause** (assets to another 501(c)(3) or governmental body).
- Don’t file yet; just have the document ready.
- **Cost:** Free until you actually file.

### 6. Apply for an EIN (Employer Identification Number)
- Online at [IRS EIN](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online).
- Apply as “corporation” / “other nonprofit” and use the name and address you’ll use for the corporation (can be a director’s address or registered agent).
- **Cost:** Free.

## Pause Here: First Fees

### 7. File Articles of Incorporation in Maryland
- File with [Maryland SDAT](https://dat.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx) (online or paper).
- **Fee:** ~\$170 (confirm current amount on SDAT’s site).
- **Pause** until you have this amount; then file.
- After filing, you’ll get a **charter** (certificate); keep the original.

### 8. Hold organizational meeting and adopt bylaws
- Hold the first board meeting (in person or by consent); adopt bylaws, elect officers, authorize applying for 501(c)(3), adopt conflict-of-interest policy.
- Sign and date minutes; keep in a binder.
- **Cost:** No state fee; only your time.

### 9. Apply for 501(c)(3) with the IRS
- File [Form 1023](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/applying-for-tax-exempt-status) or 1023-EZ (if you qualify).
- **Fee:** \$600 (1023-EZ) or \$750 (1023) — confirm current amount on IRS.gov.
- **Pause** until you have this; then submit.
- Can be done right after the organizational meeting.

### 10. Maryland charitable registration (when you’re ready to fundraise)
- Register with the [Maryland Secretary of State](https://sos.maryland.gov/Charity/Pages/default.aspx) before soliciting donations.
- **Fee:** Check the site for current registration fee.
- **Pause** at this step until you’re ready to solicit and have the fee.

### 11. Maryland state tax exemption
- After you have an IRS 501(c)(3) determination letter, apply for state income (and if needed, sales) tax exemption with the [Comptroller of Maryland](https://comptroller.maryland.gov/).
- Check Comptroller instructions for any fee.
