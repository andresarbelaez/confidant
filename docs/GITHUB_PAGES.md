# GitHub Pages – Landing & Download site

This repo serves a landing page for the Confidant desktop app from GitHub Pages.

## How it works

- **`landing/`** – Next.js app (shadcn/ui + Tailark Veil Kit) is the **source** for the live site.
- **`.github/workflows/deploy-landing.yml`** – On pushes to `main` that touch `landing/`, builds the Next.js app and copies `landing/out/*` into `docs/`.
- **`docs/`** – GitHub Pages serves from this folder. Its contents are generated by the deploy workflow (or can be built manually; see [landing/README.md](../landing/README.md)).

**Repo:** `andresarbelaez/confidant`. If you fork, update the URLs in `landing/src/components/confidant-*.tsx`.

The page links to **GitHub Releases** using the pattern:

`https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases/latest/download/FILENAME`

The exact installer filenames (e.g. `Confidant_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg`) are what Tauri produces when you run `npm run build` in `desktop/`; adjust the links if your build outputs different names.

## Enabling GitHub Pages

1. In your GitHub repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Choose **Branch**: `main` (or your default branch), **Folder**: `/docs`.
4. Save. The site will be available at **https://USERNAME.github.io/confidant** (e.g. `https://andresarbelaez.github.io/confidant`).

## Releases and download links

1. Build the desktop app (see [desktop/README.md](../desktop/README.md)) on macOS and/or Windows.
2. Create a **GitHub Release** (e.g. tag `v0.1.0-beta`), upload the installers from `desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
3. The download page uses `releases/latest/download/FILENAME`; "latest" is the most recent release. Keep installer filenames consistent across releases if you want "latest" to always work.

## Beta / security note

The download page includes a short note that beta builds are unsigned and users may see a security or Gatekeeper warning. This is expected for unsigned desktop apps.
