## Testing Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic logical and mathematical queries
2. **Progress Gradually**: Move to multi-step and abstract reasoning
3. **Test RAG**: Verify the knowledge bank is being used appropriately
4. **Note Patterns**: Observe where the agent struggles or excels
5. **Compare Responses**: Test the same query multiple times to check consistency
6. **Context Testing**: Try follow-up questions to test conversation memory

---

## Expected Behaviors

- **Good Reasoning**: Clear logical steps, correct conclusions, explanations
- **RAG Usage**: References to knowledge bank when relevant
- **Conversation Memory**: Remembers context from previous exchanges
- **Honest Uncertainty**: Admits when it doesn't know or is uncertain
- **Appropriate Responses**: Matches response length and detail to query complexity
