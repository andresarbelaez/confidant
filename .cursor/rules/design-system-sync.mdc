# Design system doc → landing sync

When you **edit** `docs/confidant-design-system.md`, always run the sync so the live design-system page is updated:

```bash
cd landing && npm run sync:design-system
```

(or from repo root: `npm run sync:design-system`)

This updates `landing/src/content/design-system.md` from the spec. Run it in the same session after any change to the design system doc.
